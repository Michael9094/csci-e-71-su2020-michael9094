Instead of static lists of criteria for successful implementation of software, products developed agilely often utilize evolving "user stories."  Stories are meant to establish shared understanding among customers, business people, developers, and anyone else who has a stake in the product's success.  Stories, then, are not inviolable requirements, but placeholders and records of conversations that happen among these folks.  Three waypoints (the 3 C's) characterize the story process: card, conversation, confirmation.  Each story's components are traditionally captured on an index **card**: user roles or personae of fictional users (the WHO), a feature or software behavior that will provide a solution for them (the WHAT), and the value the product will then provide to the user (the WHY).  The entire card becomes the focal point of a **conversation** that develops shared understanding among stakeholders and delivery team members.  One result of conversations can be a list of acceptance criteria to serve as **confirmation** to all stakeholders that the story item has been successfully delivered.  Good stories may satisfy most of the INVEST criteria:

* Independent (self-contained)
* Negotiable (delivery team has latitude to choose the implementation)
* Valuable (provides value to a customer)
* Estimable (required effort is knowable)
* Sized appropriately (smaller is better)
* Testable (can be validated)

Stories still need to be prioritized by skilled product owners, but with a prioritized list of good stories, the team is empowered to maximize the benefit to customers while minimizing misunderstandings that result in wasted effort.
